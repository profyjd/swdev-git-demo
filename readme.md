## The number 42

In "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", a group of
hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn the Answer to
the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything from the
supercomputer Deep Thought, specially built for this purpose. It takes
Deep Thought 7½ million years to compute and check the answer, which
turns out to be 42. Deep Thought points out that the answer seems
meaningless because the beings who instructed it never actually knew
what the Question was.

When asked to produce The Ultimate Question, Deep Thought says that it
cannot; however, it can help to design an even more powerful computer
that can. This new computer will incorporate living beings into the
"computational matrix" and will run for ten million years. It is
revealed as being the planet Earth, with its pan-dimensional creators
assuming the form of white lab mice to observe its running. The
process is hindered after eight million years by the unexpected
arrival on Earth of the Golgafrinchans and is then ruined completely,
five minutes prior to completion, when the Earth is destroyed by the
Vogons to make way for a new Hyperspace Bypass. In "The Restaurant at
the End of the Universe", this is revealed to have been a ruse: the
Vogons had been hired to destroy the Earth by a consortium of
psychiatrists, led by Gag Halfrunt, who feared for the loss of their
careers when the ultimate question became known.

Lacking a real question, the mice decide not to go through the whole
thing again and settle for the out-of-thin-air suggestion "How many
roads must a man walk down?" from Bob Dylan's song "Blowin' in the
Wind".
